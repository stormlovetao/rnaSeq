In earlier version, Braincode data(141 samples) are processed under this pipeline:
Reference: pipeline/preprocess_pipeline_core.sh

# This script should be run on a server with more than 64 GB mem
# Preprocess a sample(unmapped.bam)
# Step1: Filtering Low-Complexity reads and reads with length < 20bp using prinseq-lite-0.20.4
# Step2: Filtering reads from PhiX174, GI number: gi|9626372|ref|NC_001422.1, using SNAP (bowtie2 --very-sensitive-local)
# Step3: Filtering reads from hg38 + all contigs, using SNAP -mrl 20
# Step4: Filtering reads from ribosome RNA(SSU + LSU, downloaded from SILVA DB), using SNAP -mrl 20
# Step5: CirRna
# Step6: gene fusion
# Step7: run kraken

But we adopt a conciser pipeline on GTEx data (13 brain regions, 1419 samples):
Reference: /GTEx/*
That pipeline is under following:
# Step1: QC
		# Quality control
		# Filter Low complexity reads (dust, threshold=7)
		# Trim 3'/5' PolyA/T
		# Trim 5' low quality(threshold = 10)
		# Filter sequence with length less than 20
# Step2: Run Kraken

Now, I want to rerun braincode data using the gtex pipeline to double check the braincode results. Or the robustness of our first pipeline.
